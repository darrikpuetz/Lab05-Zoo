*Author: Darrik Puetz*

## Description

A zoo contains animals, and animals can come in many different shapes and sizes. It is your job to plan and build out what animals that live in the zoo.
Using UML, diagram what animals the zoo will consist of. Include in each class the properties and behaviors for each animal, as well as the relationships between each animal from itâ€™s base classes. This zoo has the ability to create new animals to put into the zoo based upon what the user inputs as choices.
